  abstract={This paper examines the impact of industrial air pollution on Louisiana real estate market outcomes–particularly the sale price of homes and the number of homes sold. Changes in weather patterns at industrial facilities impact the transport and dispersion of pollution from those facilities from one year to another. These changes in weather provide an exogenous source of variation in pollution concentrations observed at homes over time, which is exploited through the NOAA’s HYSPLIT model. Examining the near universe of home sales in Louisiana from 1998-2018, results show that the number of homes sold decrease with increases in pollution concentration, and those decreases in sales are concentrated among lower-valued homes, while higher-valued homes sell more. The relationship between pollution and home sale price per acre is largely positive and statistically insignificant.},

  abstract={We utilize a novel identification strategy to quantify the impacts of religiosity on US local labor markets. Exploiting the quasi-random variation in historical immigration from 1850 to 2010 and origin-specific religiosity, we isolate exogenous religiosity shocks at the commuting zone level for the 1940-2010 period. We find that, relative to the Unaffiliated share, an exogenous increase in Protestant, Liminal and Orthodox Christian, and “Other” religious shares decreases employment and marriage shares, whereas Jewish share increases employment and college education shares along with mean income in commuting zones. The share of married women in the workforce falls with all religious shares except Jewish share. Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity by gender. We provide suggestive evidence that these results are partially driven by the ancestral compositions of US commuting zones.},

  abstract={Using 2013 through 2020 survey waves of individual-level data from the CDCs Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the staggered adoption of “Tobacco 21” laws  across the United States, this paper examines the average treatment eﬀect of an increase in tobacco-purchasing-age on underage drinking. This analysis finds that overall, Tobacco 21 policy largely has an inconclusive or null impact on youth smoking participation. Though results for New Jersey and Oregon suggest that alcohol and tobacco are complements for youth in those states, Tobacco 21 policy induces less smoking and drinking in one state and more in another.},
