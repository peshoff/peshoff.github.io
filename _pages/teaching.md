### Select Comments from Students This Past Semester
These comments were shared in official, non-compulsory, anonymous student evaluations completed by students who took ECON 2035 "Money, Banking, and Macroeconomic Activity" with me in Fall 2024[^1].

> Ms. Peshoff was one of the most well-structured professors I’ve ever had. Her PowerPoints were clear and concise. Her explanations translated economics into English. Her exams actually tested our knowledge on what she was teaching us. Highly recommend her course.

> I have had Ms. Peshoff for two semesters now, and I absolutely love her teaching style! She gives you what you need to know and explains things to where an average student can understand tough concepts. Further, she provides plenty of visuals (graphs!) and examples to go along with problems. She always makes content–related jokes and commentary that is really funny, and knows how to capture the attention of the students who come to learn. She is always prompt in responding to emails, and is happy to schedule office hours. I really appreciate her and have enjoyed the time I've had with her as my professor.

> Professor Peshoff's lectures are engaging and she explains the material very well. She simplifies hard economic concepts into manageable forms that we understand.
